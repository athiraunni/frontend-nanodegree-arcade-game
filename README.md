# Code worked and played game.
 This is my 2nd attempt on creating/modifying a game.
 Really glad for the scratch and perfect comments in each file. It really helped. 
# Game Instructions : 
Move player from grassland to water area through the bricks without touching the bugs. Beware Bugs are gonna kill you. Don't worry there is after life death ;) 
# To run the game in your system:
Download entire repository. Unzip it and open the "index.html" file using your browser.
# Have fun in playing.
